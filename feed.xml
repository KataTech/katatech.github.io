<h3 id="first-of-all-who-is-speaking">First of all, who is speaking?</h3>

<p>For context, I am a first-generation and low-income Asian American student who obtained a B.A. in Computer Science from Rice University. I have lived in a single-family household since high school junior year — my dad passed away from cancer. My bank account was at $1,000 at the start of college, a generous donation from my mom. I have a sister who was 8 years old when I started undergrad, and my mom does not speak English. I am an immigrant myself. To my knowledge, our household savings are less than the 4-year full cost of attendance at Rice sticker price.</p>

<p>Contrary to the above “disadvantages”, I spent 10 years in Hong Kong, where mathematical education is generally more rigorous than that of the US. The competition is also more fierce, akin to some high schools here. I was also fortunate to be placed in a public school system (FBISD) that regularly sends its top students to Ivy League schools. Moreover, I grew up in the Houston area, with regular support from my caring mother and a car at my disposal — a luxury that students coming from far away may not enjoy. Lastly, I am a US citizen, which qualifies me for certain funding available to domestic students. I am aware that many FLI students do not share these advantages.  <a name="tldr"></a></p>

<h3 id="tldr-on-fli-resources-at-rice">TL;DR on FLI Resources at Rice</h3>

<p>I believe that Rice is one of the best universities for supporting low-income students.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have <em>never</em> paid out-of-pocket for <em>anything</em> I considered career development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in doubt, always contact the <a href="https://success.rice.edu/first-generation-and-low-income">Office of Student Success Initiative</a>. At the time of writing, their email is <a href="mailto:success@rice.edu">success@rice.edu</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to formal school programs, my peers were very understanding and made low-income a status without shame. I don’t vouch for all things at Rice (as one wouldn’t for all organizations) but if you are debating about attending Rice due to a limited income background, I would not worry.</p>

<p>Below is a list of first-year questions I had:</p>

<p><strong>What if things go wrong during move-in?</strong></p>

<p>Talk to your O-Week advisors. On the rare occasion they are unhelpful, go to the O-Week Coord or another advisor. You’re bound to find one non-asshole and I urge you to take charge of this! I actually had my hard-lens contact stuck in my eyes on the first day of O-Week due to a deformed removal tool. I told my O-Week advisor and he went to 3 stores before Lunch to try and find a replacement. Ultimately, my mom drove to my optometrist and then to Rice because this stuff is specialized. However, his actions speaks to how much students value the <a href="https://admission.rice.edu/life-rice/community">Culture of Care</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paying for Textbooks?</strong></p>

<p>Submit a request at <a href="https://aop.rice.edu/">Access &amp; Opportunity Portal</a>. I probably got ~$1500 worth of stuff covered over my time total at Rice. If you need a physical text, you can check them out for a semester via AOP. <a href="https://library.rice.edu/">Fondren Library</a> offers digital copies and printing services on request. You can also find many open-sourced materials on <a href="https://annas-archive.org/">Anna’s Archive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Cheap Room Decor?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/643339369013402/">Rice Students Selling Stuff</a> FB page. Most useful for students moving off-campus, check during end-of-semesters.</p>

<p><strong>Getting professional headshot &amp; formal clothing?</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://ccd.rice.edu/">Rice CCD</a> runs a photoshoot usually in September and they have a partnership with Dress for Success to get you stuff for interviews.</p>

<p><strong>IDK what to major in!</strong></p>

<p>Great question to approach multiple <a href="https://oaa.rice.edu/advising-network/peer-academic-advisors">PAAs</a> with (either at your home college or elsewhere). In my sophomore year, I also bugged a ton of friends at Brown to compile a 67-paged <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_EN_aRRzAdLNstJx14fTum9a8_IdrGvPR1Lcy_tBiI/">document</a> with resources from every major at the time. Take the POVs with a grain of salt of course – there is not one way to finish a major. Generally, if you are considering an (ABET accredited) Engineering degree, you need to take Gen Chem and Physics in your 1st year. Other majors are typically doable in 3 (or maybe less with summer classes).</p>

<p><strong>Struggling in classes?</strong></p>

<p>Go to office hours hosted by professors/TAs and be <em>bold</em>(lol) on asking questions. Don’t ask for the answers (esp. for intro courses) because that will only support you in the short term. It is perfectly fine to ask for approaches or alternative explanations instead. Some awkward silences for you to think are also okay — in fact, I encourage you to ask for some time to think through it first if you need to! It may take going to a few different people to find the right one — the same logic applies to therapists.</p>

<p><strong>Does Rice cover for health insurance?</strong></p>

<p>Rice does not tell you whether it will cover your healths insurance ahead of Aetna enrollment. I qualified for a federal Pell Grant and the full amount of Rice investment, I got full coverage from Aetna by Rice for all 4 years. Make sure to email <a href="mailto:fina@rice.edu">fina@rice.edu</a> asking for the Allen Insurance Scholarship. Moreover, appointments at Rice Health Services (behind Brown College) are free — and they cover a lot of basic services for free/low charge. Their services are also irrespective of your insurance.</p>

<p><strong>Should I go for external scholarship?</strong></p>

<p>External scholarships go towards covering your out-of-pocket costs. If your tuition and housing costs are fully covered by Rice already, then Rice will deduct your external scholarship amount from their financial aid, effectively giving these students zero incentive for securing them. To my knowledge, the loopholes are (1) $2500-5000 can go to Federal Work-Study, and (2) $1000 can go towards a lifetime laptop budget. I would recommend always reporting your external scholarship to not risk losing the substantial Rice Investment amount. Cash rewards, such as winnings from writing competitions and Hackathons, do not count as scholarships and thus do not need to be reported.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have extra financial tips??</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Open a high-yield savings account, especially when you live off-campus. Dump your housing stipend in there and withdraw every month to pay rent, this earns you on average 2-5% interest which is higher than the 0.001% (or whatever) from basic accounts.</li>
  <li>Uber Eats and GrubHub often give discounts after some period of pause on activity. Exam periods are usually a good time to cash in on the discounts</li>
  <li>Amazon Prime offers a free 6-month trial per student email address. What is the limit of student alias emails you can make at Rice? <em>Answer: more than 4 years worth of free Amazon Prime.</em> <a name="career"></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="first-year-stress-points-in-career-development">First-year stress points in career development</h3>

<p>If finding a financially secure post-graduate plan is also at the top of your mind, here are some early milestones that were intimidating to me. Note again, some opinions may be more STEM-related.</p>

<p><strong>Resume</strong></p>

<p>You might have crafted a resume for college admission, but the expectations are slightly different when you are in college. A few pointers I have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every industry has a different standard. If you have a career direction in mind, look up Rice alums in that area via LinkedIn — you can find many example resumes typically.</li>
  <li>Do NOT include your phone number or address on public resumes. You’re gonna get a bunch of scam calls.</li>
  <li>Quantify your accomplishments when you can. You can’t magically quantify experiences that you never collected data for. As a first-year, it’s important to get in the mindset of thinking about <em>how your experiences can be quantified</em> to convey <em>competence in a particular field</em>. Below are example metrics for common underclassmen involvements:
    <ul>
      <li>If you TA’d: number of students you supported, homework graded, Piazza posts answered. Do be careful that you violate FERPA though — when in doubt, be careful or check with course instructors.</li>
      <li>If you did outreach: the programs that your advisees went to, the number of people you helped, the number of peers you managed to deliver a piece of work.</li>
      <li>If you did an internship: how many customers did your product impact, evaluation metrics before delivering a piece of work, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you start tracking data, you will find that you will be in a surprisingly good position by your Sophomore and Junior years.</li>
  <li>List clubs under experience, esp. for project-based organizations like Rice Eclipse and Rice Apps. Write the organization name without the word “club” to avoid scrutiny from resume parsers. Also, diversified experience can be a strength. Many organizations are looking for generalists — a mixture of technical competence and the ability to collaborate, manage, and lead.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p>

<p>LinkedIn is a professional social media platform. It is more relevant to folks entering the industry (as opposed to further education), but I recommend everyone to have a <strong>free</strong> LinkedIn profile in case their trajectory changes. In my first semester, I remember a comment from an upperclassman that stung me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re an Engineering student, you have to have a LinkedIn right? Everybody has it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was terrified about what to put on my LinkedIn.. well I had nothing but my high school GPA, a research “internship” where I was just putting glasses in a furnace, and the fact that I attend Rice now.</p>

<p><em>It’s fine if you are in this boat, just make an account + put what you can anyway.</em></p>

<p>Over time, you will realize that you have more things to add. Count the creation of the LinkedIn profile as a small win — I remember even finding a <em>comfortable</em> photo was a challenge. And if you hate LinkedIn because it is cringe, trust me I do too. I don’t like scrolling it or posting about little things, but I must admit that it is useful when you need to find an internship and stay in touch with folks from conferences. Just don’t install the app on your phone.</p>

<p>As for the benefits, I find LinkedIn most explicitly useful when I meet people at conferences — LinkedIn stood out as the most professional way to stay in touch. Affiliations can change, so recording email is less reliable. Implicitly, I suspect some recruiters have checked my LinkedIn page before giving me an interview.</p>

<p>I also observe that younger students often contact me through LinkedIn. So there is good you can do with the platform. If you are interested in sharing your experience with others, just also be aware that pooling multiple perspectives is important. So, I recommend suggesting other resources for the students you speak with to supplement your experiences.</p>

<p><em>If you still don’t vibe the idea of having a LinkedIn, many people do fine without it.</em></p>

<p>While I advocate for having an account and believe that it is beneficial to my career, I also know many friends without one who are happy and successful without the platform. Handshake and 12Twenty are also good alternatives to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Internship</strong></p>

<p>For the uninitiated (like myself once was), <em>internships</em> are temporary work experiences obtained during college. They can also be great cash flows, with some internships paying upwards of $30,000. From my observations, career success post-undergraduate is more positively correlated with internships than grades, which might be surprising to many. Logistically, internships often occur in summers between your semesters, and they are preceded by a <em>recruiting season</em> a couple of months ahead. Recruiting seasons are periods when organizations post their internship openings on their website, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, or other job search platforms. For tech, recruiting season was traditionally in the fall before the internship summer. For consulting and investment banking, it might even happen a whopping year before.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>My Credentials:</strong> You can see on my resume that I did research pretty much all of my time at Rice and after. Some people don’t consider research experience as an internship, and some aspects do differ. To support my advice in this section, I recruited in some capacity for all 4 years at Rice and received multiple internship and job offers. Some from industry, some from government, and some from non-profits. I had an offer from a prestigious big tech and an offer for an in-person internship in Norway. So, I did have some success with <em>applying</em>, though I ended up turning them down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Now, my tips:</strong> Getting a first-year internship is hard, but it is a <em>massive advantage</em> if you pull it off. Friends with first-year internships usually obtain a prestigious role in subsequent summers. I firmly believe that there is a snowball effect.
  Oftentimes, organizations host programs targeted directly at underclassmen from minority groups. For example, here is a list of <a href="https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/technology-internships-for-first-years-and-sophomores/">tech internships</a> maintained by Harvard, and another for <a href="https://managementconsulted.com/sophomore-summer-internships-consulting/">consulting</a>.
  If applicable to your field, research either at Rice or with an external program (e.g. NSF REU) can be more accessible. <a href="https://ouri.rice.edu/research-programs/surf">SURF</a> is the Rice flagship program. NSF maintains a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">REU search repository</a>. Sign up for departmental mailing lists (typically by declaring major/minor) to be up-to-date on opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>And if you didn’t secure a first-year internship:</strong> First of all, I believe this is the common case.
  I know many peers (including some FLIs) who springboarded from undergrad research and no-name companies to prestigious roles by their sophomore summer. As long as you do <em>something</em> that produces quantifiable bullet points on your resume, you are on a good trajectory. You can often do personal projects to compensate for formal training, such as technical writing in the humanities or software projects in computer science. Explore the full depth of what’s available! <a name="more-issues"></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="issues-typically-after-first-year">Issues typically after first-year</h3>

<p>You spend your first few months at Rice at least, and you kind of know who to go to for formal guidance. But, some questions feel less appropriate for Rice staff. Instead, you may seek perspective from a peer.</p>

<p><strong>Going off-campus, should I get a meal plan?</strong></p>

<p>You can get a surprisingly high amount of meal swipes from the donation program, especially now that they increased the donation limit. I got 50 swipes in my senior spring, which was more than enough to support the few campus meals I got. Usually, I ate at home or off-campus. If you can regularly cook/meal prep and are on the fence, I would suggest going without. If you find housing prices on par or lower than Rice’s rent, I strongly believe that you can cover healthy eating with the meal swipe donations + the occasional meal off-campus. Do allocate your budget for food <em>ahead of time</em> so you don’t skip meals.</p>

<p><strong>Traveling for a conference or internship, can I get funded?</strong></p>

<p>Many Rice organizations have funds available to help with your travel or relocation. The big two are <a href="https://ccd.rice.edu/">CCD</a> and <a href="https://success.rice.edu/">SSI</a>, but <a href="https://studentcenter.rice.edu/student-activities/club-resources/financial-resources/sapp">SAPP</a> can help with clubs and your home department might have grants too. I got ~$1000 for flight tickets and grocery charges in my junior summer for attending a mathematics REU program in NYC (yea.. this one didn’t pay enough and was reimbursed <em>after</em>). You can usually make a strong case for programs with delayed reimbursements.</p>

<p><strong>Many of my peers always go on vacation. Everyone is in Japan this summer. How can I experience that too?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I believe that traveling experiences are great financial investments. It truly gives you convenient conversation points to network (ahem) with peers organically, which can sprout into long-lasting friendships, strong referrals, and collaborations if you end up pursuing research. It also broadens your perspective on how life can look like.</p>

<p>This section purposefully combines professional and personal goals for traveling, because I believe professional travels are incredible opportunities for personal growth for FLI students. In my experience, there are tremendous financial benefits to combining the two — and a lot of people do it, despite the lack of transparency out of professional concerns.</p>

<p>One of my biggest achievements in undergrad is <em>how many places I explored on professional funding</em>. As someone who has been in Houston since immigrating and never went on a family vacation due to limited financial means, I dreamt of visiting major cities like San Francisco and New York and going abroad to Europe and Asia. Spoilers alert: I did all of that. Some tips to get free (or low-cost) travel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply to internships and research programs in places you want to visit.</li>
  <li>Rice Externships can fund travel stipends.</li>
  <li>Search for fellowships with international travel (e.g. <a href="https://ccl.rice.edu/fellowships-overview">Rice CCL</a>). Personally, I applied to a CS <a href="https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/">summer school</a> at Germany’s Max Planck Institute.</li>
  <li>Pack vacations with funded travel: Most programs provide 2 one-way tickets (for roundtrip), but you may be able to squeeze in a short vacation by self-paying one ticket.</li>
  <li>Order tickets (flight AND train, if applicable) <em>early</em>. For international trips, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/13vo884/using_vpn_to_find_cheaper_flights/">VPN to another country and booking directly from their country’s airline’s website</a> can sometimes yield cheaper prices than booking from a US IP address or US website.</li>
  <li>Find opportunities for personal growth in between professional activities! The need to rest and recharge to avoid burnout is doubly true for professional travels — where you may feel obligated to socialize with strangers at a much higher frequency. Practical planning advice: 2 activities per day, know the safe areas, and budget. <a name="cs-advice"></a></li>

<h3 id="advice-for-cs-tech-recruiting--phd">Advice for CS: Tech Recruiting &amp; Ph.D.</h3>

<p>Here is advice for folks pursuing a similar trajectory as I have in undergrad. First, there’s a <a href="https://coda.io/d/Rice-Computer-Science-Guide_dEcPwl0JjQR/Welcome_su77n?fbclid=IwAR34seYUl1bLnserMIyVGfIZ45VKSDr_KTzBCoqxWSfQvD-PTqnM_nmm-l8#_lupFc">wiki</a> made by more senior students. It remains pretty relevant IMHO.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Recruiting (e.g. Software Engineering, Product Management)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> Tech recruiting is unique in that personal projects mean a lot. Great projects (well-used, well-explained) may even compensate for the lack of formal experience. Here is a <a href="https://www.sourish.dev/blog/industry/personal-projects">piece</a> listing some ideas to start with. Some folks land interviews with resumes containing just their class projects (or some marginally extended variant) from COMP 140 and COMP 182. More original projects are often viewed preferably. I struggled with coming up with an original idea, so I tagged along on teams such as <a href="https://riceapps.org/">RiceApps</a> and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>. In particular, RiceApps runs an <a href="https://medium.com/riceapps/osa-2021-in-a-nutshell-ef8299cc02ba">Open Source Accelerator (OSA)</a> every summer to teach students web development. Sometimes, they admit pre-freshmen too. If you lean data science, you can also reproduce a notebook on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>, which hosts a ton of datasets and machine learning (ML) competitions. Some practical tips for building a project:
    <ul>
      <li>Open your terminal. Make a folder dedicated to projects by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir projects</code> and change into that directory with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd projects</code>. Do ALL of your development stuff there so you don’t clutter your computer unnecessarily. Ask ChatGPT to explain this step in detail if it confuses you (which is okay, but there’s just a ton of intricacy to terminal commands that I don’t want to dive into here).</li>
      <li>Start your project on Github and regularly commit (save your progress). GitHub is the most popular hub for open-sourced development, which means that people can see the source code of your project. The necessary basics are <a href="https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Sign up for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a> with your school email, which contains many free software services such as Co-Pilot (AI code assistant), MongoDB (for data storage), and JetBrains (fancy code editors).</li>
      <li>Follow some YouTube tutorials at first.</li>
      <li>Different from a well-scoped class syllabus, it is nearly impossible to know everything about programming. You will realize that there are like 100’s of advanced terminal commands, Github workflows, libraries out there. My advice is to focus on one small problem for your project (e.g. making a custom Diary app) and only read the necessary information to execute it. In practice, this means that you should know the git add, git commit , and git push commands. But, you should ignore the reading on git fetch when you just start. Trust me, you will get better over time!!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Coding Interview Prep:</strong> A major component of the tech internship process is coding interviews, which are algorithm brainteaser questions. Examples questions can be found on <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>, which is the most popular platform for practicing these interview questions. Many sources recommend Cracking the Coding Interview, a really thick book. I personally think it is <em>way too long</em> to get through with all 9,000 other things that you have to get done during recruiting season. Instead, I recommend studying the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed">14 Leetcode Patterns</a> and sampling a few problems in <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions">Blind 75</a>. In terms of how the sampling should be done, a friend once recommended this strategy: for refreshers or topics you used in class, do 1-3 easy’s and 1-2 medium’s. For concept that you have trouble implementing (e.g. heap questions), do a majority of the problems and make notes. At Rice, the COMP 140, COMP 182, and COMP 215 sequence prepares you well for these interviews. Less is more. Train you ability to detect the pattern, group problems. Don’t treat every problem as an isolated instance — otherwise it can be hugely overwhelming. It’s a fine strategy to prioritize coding interview prep in freshmen summer (or summers in general).</li>
  <li><strong>Applying:</strong> Mass apply. Use an automatic application filler like <a href="https://simplify.jobs/">Simplify</a>. Find a list of companies such as from <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/internships/">Levels.fyi</a>. Pittsburgh Computer Science Club also maintains a <a href="https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships">list</a> every year on Github. Commit short amount of time per day to just send out resumes. For me, 5-10 minutes was good for getting over 100 applications out without feeling burnout.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Research, Graduate School (Ph.D.)</strong></p>

<p>First of all, if you are at all interested in machine learning research, check out this <a href="/blog/2023/ml-at-rice/">post</a>. Secondly, you don’t need a Master’s before applying to a PhD program in CS (and many adjacent fields). Thirdly, don’t go to an unfunded PhD program — you should always expect a living stipend. Fourth, a PhD is more like a job than being an undergraduate student. Lastly, the people you work with and life outside of work matters.</p>

<p>Onto specific tips entering graduate school season.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request an application fee waiver (or at least know how it works) by November. It’s different at every school, and some may take days to process (looking at you, UT Austin ECE).</li>
  <li>Alex Lang’s <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship">NSF material repository</a>. Useful for finding examples of research proposal too.</li>
  <li>Research output is important, but don’t get discouraged without a publication. Your narrative, passions, knowledge on the field, and intuition are considered too. Knowing professors from conferences or emails ahead of application season can be <em>really</em> helpful.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WfoMVkEbsn03Xz0Q2_YQPlWy2YrS0m4R2vK2nsekvcQ/edit">How to prep for Grad School if you’re poor</a></li>
  <li>Many schools run graduate application assistance programs, e.g. <a href="https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/">MIT EECS GAAP</a>.</li>
  <li>Graduate school admission happens in rounds, and not everyone apply out of undergrad (in fact, this is probably less common across the board). Some folks at my PhD school (MIT) applied in multiple cycles. Some took time off to work in industry, while others found research assistant roles to craft a stronger application and learn more about their own interests. The journey can take multiple forms.</li>
  <li>Talk to current graduate students at the labs you plan to apply to. Learn about the pros/cons of their advisors. Sometimes, it takes talking to multiple students to learn about the red flags. Here is a good <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/03/02/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-ph-d-advisor-on-visit-day-with-thorough-and-forthright-explanations/">list</a> of questions. <a name="closing"></a></li>

<h3 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h3>

<p>This piece aims to share my advice to help bridge the gap between FLI students and our more prepared peers. My challenges were mostly in navigating college norms, financial resources, and recruiting culture for high-earning, prestigious careers. Thus, I aim to help FLI students identify campus resources and compete for lucrative career roles. Throughout my time at Rice though, short-term financial gains gradually lowered in priority. The origin of this shift in priority comes from fruitful discussions over <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Ivan-Ilyich-Bantam-Classics/dp/0553210351">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a> in FWIS 100, led by Prof. Burke Nixon. My present belief is that my (and my family’s) financial needs are moderate enough to allow me to pursue a PhD, which is mostly fueled by my passion for mathematics and desire to create positive social impact.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, please send me an email!</p>

<p>I did have a fair amount of success, such as finding an amazing, diverse lab where I worked with my PI and his collaborators 1:1. I was also fortunate to have participated in prestigious REUs at Berkeley AI Research and the NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. But, I also suffered from imposter syndrome and debated about pursuing graduate school for a long time. In being honest, I hope that I can be helpful for students interested in machine learning, research, and trying to find the thing they want to focus on.</p>

<h3 id="starting-with-courses">Starting with courses.</h3>

<p>As of writing this piece, machine learning (ML) has a huge presence on Rice campus. For better or worse. 
If you have ever considered taking an introductory ML course, you might notice that there are at least 4 options (well… really 6, but for most undergrads only 4 of them are commonly talked about)</p>
<ul>
  <li>ELEC 478: Introduction to Machine Learning</li>
  <li>ELEC 378: Machine Learning: Concepts &amp; Techniques</li>
  <li>STAT 413: Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning</li>
  <li>DSCI 303: Machine Learning for Data Science</li>
  <li>COMP 540: Statistical Machine Learning</li>
  <li>INDE 577: Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these classes fulfill the same requirements at Rice, so they are comparable. As a former head PAA who advised underclassman and consulted many upperclassmen about these choices, my advice is that you just pick one at your earliest prepared semester, i.e. after a basic comfort with linear algebra and statistics.</p>

<p>Prioritize the instructor effectiveness and know that COMP 540 is the only one that is implementation-heavy, which is great background for implementing models from scratch, although I don’t personally think that’s a significant competitive advantage for getting into much ML careers.</p>

<p>After the introductory courses, there are tons of specialized electives. These are the ones that I have heard are good or taken for myself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>COMP 330: Tools and Models for Data Science
    <ul>
      <li>A mix-bag of topics that are useful for industry-inclined too! Databases, cloud, and deep learning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/comp414-514/">COMP 414: Algorithms, Complexity, and Approximation</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Really an optimization foundations in ML course. For those interested in ML theory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>COMP 442: Reinforcement Learning</li>
  <li><a href="https://computervision.rice.edu/">COMP 447: Computer Vision</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Quite different than the more classical approach at Rice, now with a lot of deep learning!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://cs.rice.edu/~al110/teaching/mlg_S21.html">COMP 559: Machine Learning with Graphs</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Covered lots of spectral methods, graphical models, and fun proofs! Not tons of GNN.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-get-involved-in-research">How do I get involved in Research?</h3>

<p>If you read this far, I assume that you are moderately interested in machine learning. In that case, the first question to ask is not whether you should choose between ML engineering, software engineering, or machine learning.</p>

<p><strong>The first question to ask is how to get your foot in the door.</strong></p>

<p>In my (and many others) experience, it takes an incredible amount of luck or experience (or both) to get into an industry position for machine learning (or even moderately close to it as a SWE). IMHO, the sure-fire way to focus on ML at Rice – and other schools with a good ML researcher to student ratio – is to reach out to a faculty and join their project.</p>

<p>I am skeptical as to whether most freshman can meaningfully contribute to a project during their academic semester, especially if you didn’t already have a lot of advanced background coming in. Personally, I didn’t and thus devoted a lot of effort towards a solid foundation in statistics, algorithmic thinking, general math fluency (proofs and the specific prerequisites of ML). If you find some down-time early in your career, I highly recommend working through significant portions of either <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> or <a href="https://d2l.ai/">Dive into Deep Learning</a>.</p>

<p>My caution against entering ML research too early is because it’s tricky to balance coursework and research. This is especially true for those of us who are wired to the organized deadlines in classes, but never experienced anything like research where you bang your head repeatedly and are confused by most you read. People have a wide range of opinions on how to proceed here, but I think you should at least get the hang of classes before jumping in. <strong>Optimal time points are summer of freshman year or sophomore year while/after taking an ML class in tandem.</strong> But, it is never too late to get started.</p>

<p>Some possible issues with entering too early, ordered by likelihood:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You feel lost, your advisor doesn’t have time to be a 1-1 tutor when you are so early in your understanding, you feel demotivated, and you either explicitly quit or start quiet-quitting. The latter is both likely and common.</li>
  <li>You spend most of your time learning the basics of machine learning with an advisor that can meet you about once a week with expertise on sub-areas. You could’ve had a better and broader learning experience by enrolling (or even special registering) into one of the intro ML courses, go to office hours, make friends, and develop a strong foundation for starting your research.</li>
  <li>You decided that you want to focus a lot of your effort on research (which is good in general), but you end up sacrificing your class attendance, doing relevant practice problems, and the bulk of a course that’s rudimentary in the machine learning research space, i.e. linear algebra, probability &amp; statistics, or introduction to machine learning. <em>This, in my opinion, is bad</em>. It takes some experience to know when sacrificing other commitments for research is good, and it rarely happens in your first semester.</li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, you could probably enter the sphere of ML around sophomore year. In my opinion, trading off the first year to get a strong academic and social foundation at Rice is worthwhile for you and your advisor. Now, you are probably thinking about: <em>so how do I join a lab?</em></p>

<p><strong>Gauge lab fit from folks who work with the advisor!</strong></p>

<p>Some (maybe even a lot of) people would recommend asking one of your course professors for research opportunities, mass-emailing PIs, and reading their publications to maximize your chance of joining a lab. I don’t fully agree with all of that, especially if you are just starting. Instead, I suggest the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take a further look into your future, I would trace backwards from there. How likely do you see yourself pursuing graduate school, and what about industry? If you are in an exploratory stage (which is good), then I suggest focusing on working with a PI or lab that can teach you alot and not focus too much on the advisor’s research output, especially if they are junior faculty. A common way to measure research output is the advisor’s h-index, the citations of their papers, and their collaborators - all of which can be reasonably found on Google Scholar. For the interest of undergrad research, I don’t think h-index should matter that much.. again, especially for junior faculty. In terms of figuring out your research interest, you probably already have a good vague idea. Do your due dilligence and browse the Rice research tabs to figure out all the faculty in your area of interest. In terms of actually learning about their work, I recommend the following exercises (ordered by low-to-high effort): try to make a quick mental note about what their area is called, what problem is their most recent paper (or two) trying to address - give that a one sentence description, and lastly, do a deep search over their group members to find people to talk to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t recommend reaching out to a faculty first, unless you already know them. I do recommend reaching out to graduate students and undergrads if you identified any on the faculty’s website. What’s important to ask is the general culture fit and advisor strength/weakness, and here’s a good <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/03/02/questions-to-ask-a-prospective-ph-d-advisor-on-visit-day-with-thorough-and-forthright-explanations/">guide</a> by CMU to help you formulate specific questions that are important to YOU. For me, I value how socially connected, ambitious, and diverse my advisor’s lab is. And I am grateful everyday for choosing the lab that I did. 
Aim to email around 5-8 undergrad/graduate students and talk to 3 PIs before making a decision.</p>

<p>Once you feel ready though, there are a lot of options at Rice. Our departments have recruited many faculty members conducting machine learning research over the years… For ex. we have Akane (ML for Health), Vicky Yao (ML for Cancer Biology), Tasos (Optimization for Deep Learning), Santiago (Graph Neural Networks), Arlei (Graph ML), César (Federated/Distributed Learning), Vaibhav Unhelkar (Robotics and Human-AI Interaction), Vicente Ordonez (CV &amp; NLP), Anshu (Efficient DL), RichB (almost anything ML/DL) etc.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="now-that-i-am-in-research-what-should-i-look-out-for">Now that I am in research, what should I look out for?</h3>

<p>Here are some common problems that early researchers run into, and my thoughts about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am stuck, not making a lot of progress, and reading all the time. Am I doing bad?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My advisor, <a href="https://cauribe.rice.edu/">César</a>, told me that research is non-linear and maybe even exponential. A challenging part of research is <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/">identifying the right problem to work on</a>. This cannot happen if you are tunnel visioned. I spend the first semester of working with César mostly just reading about optimal transport, optimization, and solidifying my background in machine learning. I made a lot of progress in my second semester, generated many results, written a lot of code, and presented our preliminary results in the Rice conference. Just because you aren’t doing anything that shows right now doesn’t mean you are not making progress. I would seek frequent feedback from your advisor and trust their expertise. Worthwhile projects can take a bit of time to hammer out. And worthwhile questions to ask may take even longer to find. <strong>Don’t be discourage if success does not happen immediately.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should take a course on X before doing research in X.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Despite my earlier rant about solidifying a core background before jumping into research. Once you are pass the point of bare minimum, you really learn most by learning from the expert in the problem space you are trying to work in, reading the relevant literature, and getting your hands dirty.</p>

<p>In most instances, that person is going to be the very person who recruited you to work on this project… well at least within your space of potential mentors, and the project will naturally present a series of candidate literatures and tasks. If you’re doing research in a specific optimization algorithm to speed up deep neural network training, it might be helpful to sit through the basics of convex optimization, but it certainly won’t be nearly as helpful as starting the research. As <a href="https://akyrillidis.github.io/about/">Tasos</a> told me once, you gotta be efficient too!</p>

<p>Read, get feedback from your mentor, try things out, rinse and repeat. Progress can feel slow in the beginning, but you are probably on a steady track towards your research goals. It is important to start!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t want to meet my advisor/mentor because I haven’t made much progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If anything, the moments that you are stuck are the most important times to meet. Feeling stuck as an undergrad is necessary, but also dangerous if you suffer in silence. Get feedback before you dive too deep into a rabbit hole and lose motivation. This cannot be overvalued when you are early in your research career.</p>

<h3 id="so-can-you-work-in-ml">So… can you work in ML?</h3>
<p>With the increasing attention that the field is getting, there are MANY job opportunities for it. And from the above content, I hope you have a clearer idea and an actionable plan on how to get your foot in the door by joining a ML lab early in your research career.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the actual relevant question to ask is should you work in ML?</p>

<p><strong>An (Ethical and Practical) Debate about AI/ML Research</strong></p>

<p>Over the past few semesters, I notice a lot of students asking about how to get involved with ML with little familiarity for what the field is. This is great in that it’s a fascinating rich field with a lot of community interest, and therefore there’s a lot of funding, projects, and mentors in the sphere. I also by no means want to gatekeep.</p>

<p>However, my extended engagement with ML led me to reflect on whether working in machine learning provides a net positive for the society. Intelligence is fascinating, and so is understanding it. But, many developments for machine learning are kickstarted by efforts to build better attention-retaining mechanisms, product recommendations, and to some extremes, autonomous weapons for the military. Read more from <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/how-data-happened">“How Data Happened”</a> on how the origins of statistics is deeply intertwined with war.</p>

<p>A lot of researchers will claim that they are just working on the tools, and not responsible for their use case. I (and originally, <a href="https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/">Phillip Rogaway</a>) argue that in choosing a project to work on, you are making an active decision on what not to contribute to. And this absolutely impacts the trajectory of our society. At its core, machine learning is about producing insights for the future based on patterns of the past. Despite efforts in areas like ML fairness and interpretability, you are fundamentally contributing to a field that enables large-scale, efficient, autonomous reproduction of past behaviors. This may be adversarial to promoting important social changes to our society.</p>

<p>For every student who has had a slight thought about making the world a better place, I recommend this original <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/crisis/crisis.pdf">piece</a> by Dr. Rogaway that revolutionalized my assessment for what it means to do good in the world. As always, don’t blindly trust what others say, but this is one of the most eye-opening, compelling, and tragic opinions I came across in my 4 years studying computer science.</p>

<p>To sprinkle a bit of positivity before we close up, read up on why <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/">your career choice is one of the most meaningful decisions you can make and some steps toward performing rigorous analysis of your options</a>. If you pursue AI/ML, I plead that you take your contributions seriously and consider the impact it may have for the future generation.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="for-the-future-you-that-does-becomes-a-researcher">For the future you that does becomes a researcher…</h3>

<p>The current state of the machine learning field is both exciting and concerning. As a student who’s spend a few years conducting research that falls under this broad umbrella term, I find it thrilling that almost everybody is excited to talk about some form of machine learning. However, this leads to the thousands of preprints on ArXiv everyday, surely too massive for any single reasonable researcher to consume. I invite you to survey this insightful article on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03341">Troubling Trends in Machine Learning Scholarship</a> and be aware of some counterproductive tendencies within the ML scientific community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did I end up doing? And should you trust me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t place my outcome because I think, too often, we are misinformed by survivorship bias. Professors encouraging us to pursue an academic career because they were top performers. Software engineers encouraging us to join X company because they got a bunch of money from the position. For those of us figuring out what to do, there is a lot of value in hearing failures too. In fact, two of the most valuable things you can do in undergrad is exploration and looking for failures. <strong>So, evaluate my words yourself.</strong> I hope that you will find that at least some parts may be sensical. At the very least, I hope you found the pointers as valuable as I have.</p>

<p><strong>If you identify as a first-generation/low-income or, more broadly, underrepresented minority, please feel free to reach me via one of my contact options for a chat at any time.</strong> I am always happy to be a rubber duckie for fellow students who want to make their world, their community a better place than when they arrived in it.</p>

<h4 id="my-views-on-rice-cs-as-a-fgli-student"><strong>My views on Rice CS as a FGLI student</strong></h4>

<p>A lot of people reach out to me (often via Reddit) to ask me about my experience at Rice as a CS major.</p>

<p>Often, I find myself regurgitating the same responses, and I thought it be appropriately to hone in the details of my perspective and place it out in the open. I intend to curate a more complete article in my senior spring semester, but until then we will focus on “Rice CS as a FGLI student”.</p>

<p>First of all, what is FGLI? It stands for “first-generation, low-income” student, which is what I am. This is not a tag that students wear around campus, and it’s usually not a great conversation start. But it is who I am, and I am grateful for my parents’ sacrifices that led me to become the first to attend college.</p>

<p>Being a FGLI student at Rice CS has been a solid time since our curriculum does not assume students background. Rather, emphasis is placed on “problem-solving” for our introductory CS course taught by Dr. Scott Rixner. This approach is advantageous because there are concepts that student without coding background can grasp immediately, since everyone has some level of experience with solving difficult problems. I am an advocate for a lack of “honors” or “accelerated” CS sequence since it standardizes the knowledge base for students in their introductory sequences, before everyone specialization in their own paths (whether that be via courses, internships, extracurriculars, etc.) Icing on the cake is that I have never paid for my own textbook and managed to save a ton of money every summer thanks to Rice.</p>

<p>Often, I also receive questions such as “what makes CS at Rice standout or different?” Without a doubt, many of these came from desperate high school seniors trying to finish a “Why Rice?” essay with less than 30 minutes worth of research. But I was there once, so I will write a bit. Below are some of my highlights:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Our proximity to the <a href="https://www.tmc.edu/">Texas Medical Center</a> yield exciting intersections between CS and healthcare. A few examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>computational biology (<a href="https://www.kavrakilab.org/">Lydia Kavraki</a>, <a href="https://www.treangenlab.com/">Todd Treangan</a>)</li>
      <li>AI for health (<a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vy/">Vicky Yao</a>, <a href="https://compwell.rice.edu/">Akane Sano</a>, <a href="http://sh.rice.edu/">Scalable Health Lab</a>)</li>
      <li>computational neuroscience and neuroengineering (<a href="http://rnel.rice.edu/">Caleb Kemere</a>, <a href="https://xaqlab.com/">Xaq Pitkow</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rice’s small size + large endowment implies an abundance of opportunities and fundings per student:
    <ul>
      <li>our countless REUs (<a href="https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/opportunities/reu-data-science">Data Science</a>, <a href="https://eceweb.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/research-experiences">ECE</a>, <a href="https://statistics.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate/research-experiences-undergraduates">STAT</a>, and <a href="https://ouri.rice.edu/research-programs/surf">SURF</a> which is not department specific)</li>
      <li>an <a href="https://graduate.rice.edu/academics/finance/wagoneraward">alternative</a> to Fullbright for Rice students only</li>
      <li>full-year funded exchange program with <a href="https://abroadtd.rice.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&amp;id=37655">Cambridge University</a> in England!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No doubt, most Rice applicants have heard that we are consistently ranked as the #1 happiest campus. There is a lot of truth to that ranking as Rice bolsters a collaborative, supportive community. For me, it was an exciting, accepting environment where intellectual conversations originate from the passion/quirkiness of our students. Not to say that there aren’t flaws, but I believe that there’s something for most folks.</li>

<h4 id="my-research-interests"><strong>My Research Interests</strong></h4>

<p>As alluded on the front page, I am broadly interested in AI/ML with a focus on computational optimal transport and graph representation learning. I am also open to any AI/ML problems with a math-driven criterion and/or connections to responsible, robust, and fair usage of said systems.</p>

    Graphs. Illustration by Jovana Andrejevic.

<p>One can think of “graphs” as “networks”, although graphs are a more general mathematical construct to capture relationships. Networks are manifestations of graphs. There are examples of graphs everywhere such as your friend network on social media and the transmission network of COVID-19 within a community.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by graphs because they capture relationships and interactions betweens entities (mostly humans). <strong>Graph representation learning</strong>, then, is the study of finding appropriate latent representations (often in the form of matrices or vectors) of graphs for decision-making and inference by AI systems.</p>

<p>I believe advancements in graph representation learning can drive…</p>
<ul>
  <li>A safer, less polarized online community by finding optimal connections between different groups</li>
  <li>Tracking of disease outbreak and high-vulnerability points in a complex, connected system</li>
  <li>Efficiency of multi-agent AI and distributed ML systems</li>
  <li>and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>What of <strong>computational optimal transport</strong>? To put simply, optimal transport (OT) is a field that studies natural geometries between probability distributions. With optimal transport, one can define distances and find interpolations between objects that cannot be compared easily via the Euclidean distance metric.</p>

<p>Above are results of Dr. Justin Solomon (MIT EECS) in applying OT to find interpolations between three objects: the red cow, blue duck, and the green donut. Here, it is shown that OT concepts may be applied to objects that are not restricted to metrics and probability measures.</p>

<p>I focus on applying OT concepts to graphs, thereby deriving new and interpretable graph representations. This is an exciting area supported by many before me, and I was lucky to have contributed to an exciting news lens of classical regression for graph prediction!</p>
