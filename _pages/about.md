Welcome! I am a undergrad junior studying Math & CS at Rice University. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests are in AI/ML, optimal transport, and networks. I am especially drawn to mathematically-driven solutions to pressing challenges in healthcare, medicine, and society. 

Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. C&eacute;sar A. Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Lydia Beaudrot](https://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) from Rice to work on exciting applications of optimal transport to food web network data analysis. Previously, I interned at Berkeley AI Research under [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/alison) and MD Anderson Cancer Center under [Dr. Jagan Sastry](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jagannadha_sastry.html). 

In my free time, I mostly watch movies and TV shows with my little sister. I also try to sprinkle my days with light math reading, a moderate amount of coding, and the occasional basketball games with my friends.
