Welcome! I am a 3rd-year undergrad studying Math & CS at Rice University. My research interests are in AI/ML, optimal transport, and graph representation learning. 

Currently, I am advised by [Dr. Cesar Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/). Previously, I interned at Berkeley AI Research under [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/alison) and MD Anderson Cancer Center under [Dr. Jagan Sastry](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jagannadha_sastry.html). 

In my free time, I mostly watch movies and TV shows with my little sister. I also try to sprinkle my days with light math reading, a moderate amount of coding, and the occasional basketball games with my friends.
