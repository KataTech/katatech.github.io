Welcome! I study CS and Stats at Rice University. Broadly, I am excited about math, data, and society. Lately, I work in responsible machine learning in network systems and optimal transport (OT) theory. 

Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. C&eacute;sar A. Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Lydia Beaudrot](https://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) to work on graph OT towards food web analysis. 

Previously, I worked on OT-driven variability reduction and ML fairness with [Dr. Esteban G. Tabak](https://cims.nyu.edu/~tabak/) at NYU Courant. At Berkeley AI Research, I worked on contrasting RL and human goal-seeking under [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/alison). Even earlier at MD Anderson Cancer Center, I worked with [Dr. Jagan Sastry](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jagannadha_sastry.html) on statistical modeling in service of immunotherapy treatments.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about getting involved in research (esp. ML). I am very happy to sit down at Chaus and scope out a plan for finding a research group to join with you!

A big shoutout to my future comedy partner, [Siba](https://sibasmarak.github.io/), for this sharp photo from the Eiffel tower! Lastly, check out [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) for the stylish website template. Last update 03/16/2024.
