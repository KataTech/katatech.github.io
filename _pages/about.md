I am a first-year PhD student in the [MIT Institute of Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/). My research interest lie broadly in machine learning theory and safety for social systems. I am generously supported by the NSF GRFP, and an affiliate of [LIDS](https://lids.mit.edu/). 

Previously, I completed my B.A. in Computer Science at Rice University. There, I worked with [Dr. C&eacute;sar Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Lydia Beaudrot](https://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) on optimal transport-based graph learning for ecology. I was also hosted by [Dr. Esteban Tabak](https://cims.nyu.edu/~tabak/) at NYU Courant and [Dr. Alison Gopnik](https://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley AI Research during my summers.

Outside of research, I practice Taekwondo, hike, read, and cook!

I owe much gratitude to [Shreyas Minocha](https://shreyasminocha.me/) for helping me out with random kinks on this website. Shoutout to [Siba Panigrahi](https://sibasmarak.github.io/) for my sharp photo from the Eiffel tower!
