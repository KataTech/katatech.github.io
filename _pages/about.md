Welcome! I am a senior studying Math & CS at Rice University. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests are in AI/ML, optimal transport, and networks. I am especially drawn to mathematically-driven criterions to address pressing challenges in the application of distributed and network machine learning systems to healthcare, medicine, and society.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Esteban G. Tabak](https://cims.nyu.edu/~tabak/) to develop novel theories of optimal transport for factor discovery at New York University.

At Rice, I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. C&eacute;sar A. Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Lydia Beaudrot](https://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/) to work on exciting applications of optimal transport to food web network data analysis. Previously, I interned at Berkeley AI Research under [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/alison) and MD Anderson Cancer Center under [Dr. Jagan Sastry](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jagannadha_sastry.html).
