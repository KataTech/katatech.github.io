#### **Rice University**

Advised by [Dr. C&eacute;sar A. Uribe](https://cauribe.rice.edu/) and [Dr. Lydia Beaudrot](https://lydiabeaudrot.weebly.com/).

> **TLDR:** A systemic understanding of predator-prey relationships is central to maintaining biodiversity and the well-being of an ecosystem. As anthropogenic disturbance continues to rise in Sub-Saharan Africa, we are in need of a principled apporach to study and anticipate changes among its food web networks as a result of human interference. We leverage optimal transport as the backbone of our newly proposed topological data analysis toolkit over food web networks. Check out our preliminary results below!

#### **Berkeley AI Research**

Advised by [Dr. Alison Gopnik](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu/alison) and [Eunice Yiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/euniceyiu). Supported by the [SUPERB](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/research/superb) and [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/reu.html) NSF REU programs. 

> **TLDR:** Have you ever contrasted children with adults, and maybe even artificial intelligence? Children are known to learn quickly and generalize accurately with little data to their disposal, contrary to deep neural networks and other modern machine learning frameworks. Our analysis is two-fold: (1) to understand the discrepancies in children and adults' exploration v.s. exploitation modalities through fitting experimental against reinforcement learning models, and (2) to understand the degree in which popular Q-learning-based RL algorithms can truly mimic what we observe within humans.

#### **MD Anderson Cancer Center**

Advised by [Dr. Jagan Sastry](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jagannadha_sastry.html) and [Dr. Venkatesh Hegde](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Venkatesh-Hegde). Supported by the [CPRIT CURE](https://www.mdanderson.org/education-training/degrees-programs/summer-research-programs/cprit-cure.html) summer research program. 

> **TLDR:** HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer is rising in prevalence within the U.S. accounting for over 70% of all oropharyngeal cancers. Our group developed an anti-PD1 immunotherapy therapeudic procedure, but we observed that the treatment efficacy differed wildly between tumor implants in the neck v.s. the tongue. My work centered around identifying the differentially expressed genes across these two experiments using RNA-Sequencing, and eventually constructing a set of hypothesis on the activation/deactivation of biological pathways based on the set of differentially expressed genes.
