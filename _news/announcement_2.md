These past few days, the [CMMRS](https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/) program generously funded ~80 of us from all over the world for a week-long summer school in Saarbrucken, Germany. The highlights of the program was really getting to meet people from all over the world, a pretty unusual experience for a low-income student like myself. Some of my favorite talks were from [Dr. Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/) on performative prediction, [Dr. Laxman Dhulipala](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~laxman/) on scalable graph algorithms, and [Dr. Bhattacharjee](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/) on assistive robotics. 

Of course, we also had a ton of (maybe too much) fun! A bunch of exciting research discussions with my future comedy partner [Siba](https://sibasmarak.github.io/) in particular.
